Prefix-list Role for Dell EMC Networking OS
===========================================

This role facilitates the configuration of a prefix list. It supports the configuration of ip prefix-list, and assigns the prefix-list to the line terminals. This role is abstracted for dellos9 and dellos10.


Installation
------------

```
ansible-galaxy install Dell-Networking.dellos-prefix-list
```

Requirements
------------
This role requires an SSH connection for connectivity to your Dell EMC Networking device. You can use any of the built-in OS connection variables or the ``provider`` dictionary.

Role Variables
--------------

This role is abstracted using the ``ansible_net_os_name`` variable that can take the following value "dellos9", "dellos10".

Any role variable with a corresponding state variable set to absent negates the configuration of that variable. For variables with no state variable, setting an empty value for the variable negates the corresponding configuration. The variables and its values are case-sensitive.

``dellos_prefixlist`` contains the following keys:

|        Key | Type                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type | string (required) choices: ipv4, ipv6, mac        | Configures the L3 (IPv4/IPv6) or L2 (MAC) prefix list.                                                                                                             |

|description| string           | Configures the description about the prefix list.                             |
| entries | list | Configures rules in the prefix list. See the following seqlist.* keys for each list item. |
| entries.number | int (required)       | Specifies the sequence number of the rule in prefix list.          |
| entries.permit| boolean (required): true, false         | If set to true, specifies the rule to permit packets; if set to false, specifies to reject packets.                                                                |

| entries.condition_list | list         | Configures conditions to filter packets. See condition_list.* for each item.                                                                         |
| condition_list.condition | list         | Specifies the condition to filter packets from the source address. This key is ignored when the type is MAC. |
| condition_list.prelen| string (required)      | Specifies the allowed prefix length                                      |
| entries.state | string, choices: absent, present*   | If set to absent, removes the rule from the prefix list.     |
| state | string, choices: absent, present*   | If set to absent, removes the prefix list.     |

Connection Variables
--------------------

Ansible Dell EMC Networking roles require the following connection information to establish communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in the Ansible group_vars or host_vars directories, or in the playbook itself.



|         Key | Required | Choices    | Description                              |
| ----------: | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|        host | yes      |            | Hostname or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified ``transport`` variable. The value of this key is the destination address for the transport. |
|        port | no       |            | Port used to build the connection to the remote device. If the value of this key is unspecified, the value defaults to 22. |
|    username | no       |            | Configures the username that authenticates the connection to the remote device. The value of this key authenticates the CLI login. If this key does not specify a value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME is used instead. |
|    password | no       |            | Specifies the password that authenticates the connection to the remote device. If this key does not specify a value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD is used instead. |
|   authorize | no       | yes, no*   | Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If this key does not specify a value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE is used instead. If not specified, the device attempts to execute all commands in non-privileged mode.|
|   auth_pass | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device. If ``authorize`` is set to no, then this key is not applicable. If this key does not specify a value, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS is used instead. |
|   transport | yes      | cli*       | Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. This key supports connectivity to the device over CLI (SSH).  |
|    provider | no       |            | Convenient method that passes all of the above connection arguments as a dictionary object. All constraints (such as required or choices) must be met either by individual arguments or values in this dictionary. |


```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none is specified.
```

Dependencies
------------

The dellos-prefix-list role is built on modules included in the core Ansible code. These modules were added in Ansible version 2.2.0.

Example Playbook
----------------

The following example uses the dellos-prefix-list role to configure prefix-list for both IPv4 and IPv6. The example creates a ``hosts`` file with the switch details and corresponding variables. The hosts file should define the variable `` ansible_net_os_name `` with corresponding Dell EMC networking OS name. It writes a simple playbook that only references the dellos-prefix-list role. 

Sample ``hosts`` file:
 
    leaf1 ansible_host= <ip_address> ansible_net_os_name= <OS name(dellos9)>

Sample ``host_vars/leaf1``:

    hostname: leaf1
    provider:
      host: "{{ hostname }}"
      username: xxxxx 
      password: xxxxx
      authorize: yes
      auth_pass: xxxxx 
      transport: cli

    dellos_prefixlist:
      - type: ipv4
        name: spine-leaf
        description: Redistribute loopback and leaf networks 
        entries:
          - number: 5
            permit: true
            net_num: 10.0.0.0
            mask: 23
            condition_list:
              - condition: ge
                prelen: 32
          - number: 19
            permit: true
            net_num: 20.0.0.0
            mask: 16
            condition_list:
              - condition: ge
                prelen: 17
              - condition: le
                prelen: 18
            state: present
         state: present

Simple playbook to setup system, ``leaf.yaml``:

    - hosts: leaf1
      roles:
         - Dell-Networking.dellos-prefix-list

Then run with:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yaml
